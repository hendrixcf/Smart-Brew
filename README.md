https://youtu.be/F17w-KNOAoU:  A linear actuator was attached to a blast gate. This component will sit between the coffee grinder and brew chamber and will be used to prevent coffee grinds from falling into the brew chamber. This will also prevent water vapor from rising into the coffee storage compartment.
